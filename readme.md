# The Electronics Project

A study repository. The goal is to learn PCB design — how to take a circuit idea and turn it into an actual board you can hold.

To get there, I'm working through the fundamentals first. The Arduino sketches are for getting comfortable with physical components: buttons, LEDs, reading signals, that kind of thing. The Verilog side is for understanding digital logic more deeply — how basic building blocks like registers, counters, and memory actually work together. 

The processor is being made so I can learn in the most painful way possible how electronics work at the lowest level.

## Processor (Verilog)

Built and simulated using [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital). The full schematic lives in `main.dig`.

| Module | File | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 8-bit Adder | `adder_8bit.v` | Adds two 8-bit values with carry in/out |
| 8-bit Register | `register_8bit.v` | Clocked register with write enable and synchronous reset |
| Program Counter | `program_counter.v` | Increments each clock tick, supports stop and reset |
| Memory | `memory_256x8.v` | 256-byte synchronous RAM |
| 8-to-1 Mux | `mux_8_to_1.v` | Selects one of 8 data lines |
| 8-bit Counter | `counter_8bit.v` | Counts up on each clock, with load and reset |
| Do Once | `do_once.v` | One-shot latch — lets a signal through exactly once |

## Arduino Sketches

### 1. The off-on device (completely useless)

**Description:**
A basic toggle device with a physical button and two LEDs (red and blue).

**Behavior:**
* When powered on, the red LED lights up.
* Pressing the button turns off the red LED and turns on the blue LED.
* Pressing the button again reverts the state.

**Circuit:** button on pin 9 (INPUT_PULLUP), blue LED on pin 2, red LED on pin 7.

### 2. Button test

Sets a pin HIGH. That's it.

### 3. Read test

Reads a pin and prints the value to serial. Basic intro stuff.
